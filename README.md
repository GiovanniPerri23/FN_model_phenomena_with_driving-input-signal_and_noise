# EXPLORING FITZHUGH-NAGUMO MODEL PHENOMENA WITH DRIVING INPUT SIGNAL AND NOISE 
This GitHub repository hosts an ongoing project related to nonlinear dynamics, specifically focusing on exam simulations. The project involves conducting various simulations to explore nonlinear phenomena, by adding noisy terms. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and is not yet completet.
Work was inspired by older papers, see bibliography for more informations.
